BasicAirData GPS Logger is a simple App for recording your position and your path.
It's a basic and lightweight GPS tracker focused on accuracy, with an eye to power saving.
It works offline (without internet connection), it has NO integrated maps.
This app is very accurate in determining the orthometric height (the altitude above sea level), if you enable EGM96 altitude correction on settings.
You can record all your trips, view them with any installed external viewer, directly from the in-app tracklist, and share them in KML, GPX, and TXT format in many ways.

The app is 100% Free and Open Source.

F.A.Q: 
In case of any issue, you may find it helpful to read the frequently asked questions (https://github.com/BasicAirData/GPSLogger/blob/master/readme.md#frequently-asked-questions).


IMPORTANT NOTES: 
In GPS Logger the Location is always accessed (started) when the App is in Foreground, and then is kept active also in background. On Android 10+ the app needs the Location permission "only while using the app". It doesn't need the "all the time" permission.
Depending on your Android Version, if you want to run GPS Logger reliably in background, you have to disable ALL the battery optimisations. For example you could verify in Android Settings, Apps, GPS Logger, Battery that the Background Activity is allowed and the Battery Usage is Not Optimised.
